# About Me

Hi there! üëã 

My name is Jun Qing! I am currently a full-time undergraduate student at [Monash University](https://www.monash.edu/) (Malaysia), majoring in Computer Science üë®‚Äçüíª. I am hoping to pursue a graduate school to advance my knowledge in computer science studies, focusing on Algorithms, Databases and Software Engineering.

I enjoy doing math and often practice problem solving skills with [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/imjunqing) (keen to expand to other sites like LeetCode in the near future!) Throughout my undergraduate studies, I assisted in hosting programming introductory lessons and mentoring freshman students in kickstarting their programming journey.

You can easily get in touch with me with [email](mailto:jlim0069@student.monash.edu) or telegram.
