title: Hunting for tech tools

---

I have always found myself tough to keep track of what I have discovered. I decided to make this site to keep track of what I have hunted along the adventure!

Here is a list of _**cool**_ tech tools that I have discoverd _(updated from time to time)_: 

- [FishShell](https://fishshell.com/): Replaced my day-to-day bash shell with this more efficient, simple, clean shell. Most importantly, it solves my syntax highlighting issues! **Autosuggestions just makes development so much faster.** Here is a [medium article](https://medium.com/better-programming/why-i-use-fish-shell-over-bash-and-zsh-407d23293839) that talks about its benefits.

- [source-highlight](https://www.gnu.org/software/src-highlite/): A GNU highlight library that displays a document with syntax highlighting. Embedded into my [less command](https://ole.michelsen.dk/blog/syntax-highlight-files-macos-terminal-less/).
