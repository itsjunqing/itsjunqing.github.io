# Hey 👋🏻! I am Jun! 

I am currently a graduate student of MMATH CS at the University of Waterloo's [Cheriton School of CS](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/). I recently graduated from [Monash University](https://www.monash.edu/), majoring in Computer Science studies. I will graduate from my Master's degree in 2024. 

This website serves as my garden of thoughts - a collection of things that I have learned over the years. 

I write blog posts ocasionally - though I have not got the time to write a most recent post. Feel free to have a glance over my [projects]({{site.baseurl}}/projects) accomplished, read my [blog]({{site.baseurl}}/blog) or learn more [about me]({{site.baseurl}}/about).
